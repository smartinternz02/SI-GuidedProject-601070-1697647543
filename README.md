# Online Payments Fraud Detection Using ML
Project Description:

The growth in internet and e-commerce appears to involve the use of online credit/debit card transactions. The increase in the use of credit / debit cards is causing an increase in fraud. The frauds can be detected through various approaches, yet they lag in their accuracy and its own specific drawbacks. If there are any changes in the conduct of the transaction, the frauds are predicted and taken for further process. Due to large amount of data credit / debit card fraud detection problem is rectified by the proposed method
We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, svm, and Extra tree classifier, xgboost Classifier.We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration and IBM deployment.
